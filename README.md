# Nostra Website Clone

## Project Overview
This is a **Nostra website clone** that I developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project is fully responsive, with a modern UI, and includes features like a **responsive navigation menu** and **product filtering** via checkboxes. The aim was to create a seamless user experience across different screen sizes while implementing useful features for product discovery and user interaction.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Dynamic Menu Bar**: A responsive navigation menu for enhanced user navigation.
- **Product Filtering**: A checkbox-based product filtering system to help users find products efficiently.
- **Multiple Pages**: Separate pages for collections and contact information, with functionality across all pages.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript-powered interactivity such as filtering and form handling.
